Thank you for considering my program submission. I've made adjustments based on feedback:

Dequantization Order:
Dequantization precedes bit approximation and decoding, as clarified in post #144 and the assignment spec. (https://piazza.com/class/lrgti60uc3lc6/post/144)

Mode 4 Addition:
Mode 4 is included, functioning similarly to Mode 3 but initializing iterations with 32-bit values starting from zero.
